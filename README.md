# Introduction
This project uses a single ESP8266 to replace RPI and Arduino.
![Main Screen](img/bplmain.jpg)
BrewPi is the greatest, if not the ultimate, fermentation temperature controller. The original design uses a RPI to log temperatures and maintain a temperature schedule. The RPI also hosts a web server as the front-end of internet web access. 
Using a RPI or a PC allows the maximum power of BrewPi to be used but with the additional of a RPI or PC. 

ESP8266 is cheap and powerful WiFi-enabling IOT solution. 
Although it can't be as powerful as a RPI, it's a good solution to maximize the functionality and minimize the cost. Using a single ESP8266 as the temperature controller(replacing Arduino), web server and schedule maintainer(replacing RPI) also reduces the work in building a brewpi system.

## !!Special Note
You will need to run the hardware setup procedure after upgrading to v2.4 from prior version other than Glycol option enabled. Note the configuration or save the options before you update the firmware so that you can recover the settings quickly.
 
## Known issues
* ESP8266 won't restart after saving system configuratoin.
 Sometimes ESP8266 can't restart by Software watchdog timer reset, which is the only way to reset the system by software. It did happened on my NodeMcu and D1 mini boards that didn't connect to anything but USB. I have no solution for it.
* ESP8266 won't start after selecting WiFi network.
 The web server used is ESPAsyncWebServer which uses ESPAsyncTCP. I found that if ESP8266 ever enters SoftAP mode before connecting to the network, the Web server will fail on tcp_bind() and the web service will be unavailable. Not tracing the source code of the LWIP, I just worked around by reseting the system. However, ESP8266 sometimes doesn't reset.
* The page can't be loaded correctly.
 It rarely happens after HTTP caching is used, but it does happen especially when Javascript Console is opened. During developing and testing, I found corrupted html/javascript pages. Without the abliity and time to debug or develop the web server and or TCP/IP stack, I decide to live with it.
* Incorrect tempeerature chart.
 The log format before v2.0 is vulnerable. There seems to be some unconsidered conditions that break the log.
